  paper:
    summary: "Gaucher disease (GD) is a genetic lysosomal disorder characterized by high bone marrow (BM) involvement and skeletal complications. The pathophysiology of these complications is not fully elucidated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard to evaluate BM. This study aimed to apply machine-learning techniques in a cohort of Spanish GD patients by a structured bone marrow MRI reporting model at diagnosis and follow-up to predict the evolution of the bone disease. In total, 441 digitalized MRI studies from 131 patients (M: 69, F:62) were reevaluated by a blinded expert radiologist who applied a structured report template. The studies were classified into categories carried out at different stages as follows: A: baseline; B: between 1 and 4 y of follow-up; C: between 5 and 9 y; and D: after 10 years of follow-up. Demographics, genetics, biomarkers, clinical data, and cumulative years of therapy were included in the model. At the baseline study, the mean age was 37.3 years (1–80), and the median Spanish MRI score (S-MRI) was 8.40 (male patients: 9.10 vs. female patients: 7.71) (p < 0.001). BM clearance was faster and deeper in women during follow-up. Genotypes that do not include the c.1226A>G variant have a higher degree of infiltration and complications (p = 0.017). A random forest machine-learning model identified that BM infiltration degree, age at the start of therapy, and femur infiltration were the most important factors to predict the risk and severity of the bone disease. In conclusion, a structured bone marrow MRI reporting in GD is useful to standardize the collected data and facilitate clinical management and academic collaboration. Artificial intelligence methods applied to these studies can help to predict bone disease complications."

  paper:
    summary: Genetic neuromuscular diseases are a group of disorders characterized by a progressive loss of muscle fibres and their substitution by fibrotic and fat tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful for the study of these diseases, as it identifies fat replacement in the muscles. Several studies have described patterns of muscle involvement that can guide patient diagnosis. In this project, we present a pipeline for the automatic diagnosis of muscle diseases using magnetic resonance imaging. We applied Deep Learning techniques to identify individual muscles in the images, defined an algorithm for the automated quantification of muscle tissue, and created a Machine Learning diagnosis model. This project was made possible thanks to an international network of 16 centres across 4 continents, which shared the required data for training the different models. We developed multiple tools for the processing and cohesion of the data, creating a large repository of data that will be useful for future projects.

  paper:
    summary: Genetic diagnosis of muscular dystrophies (MDs) has classically been guided by clinical presentation, muscle biopsy, and muscle MRI data. Muscle MRI suggests diagnosis based on the pattern of muscle fatty replacement. However, patterns overlap between different disorders and knowledge about disease-specific patterns is limited. Our aim was to develop a software-based tool that can recognize muscle MRI patterns and thus aid diagnosis of MDs. We collected 976 pelvic and lower limbs T1-weighted muscle MRIs from 10 different MDs. Fatty replacement was quantified using Mercuri score and files containing the numeric data were generated. Random forest supervised machine learning was applied to develop a model useful to identify the correct diagnosis. Two thousand different models were generated and the one with highest accuracy was selected. A new set of 20 MRIs was used to test the accuracy of the model, and the results were compared with diagnoses proposed by 4 specialists in the field. A total of 976 lower limbs MRIs from 10 different MDs were used. The best model obtained had 95.7% accuracy, with 92.1% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity. When compared with experts on the field, the diagnostic accuracy of the model generated was significantly higher in a new set of 20 MRIs. Machine learning can help doctors in the diagnosis of muscle dystrophies by analyzing patterns of muscle fatty replacement in muscle MRI. This tool can be helpful in daily clinics and in the interpretation of the results of next-generation sequencing tests. This study provides Class II evidence that a muscle MRI-based artificial intelligence tool accurately diagnoses muscular dystrophies.
